# Company Project Management BI System
I have worked as a BI Developer for this project which uses Power BI, Dax, MS SQL Server tools to develop a BI system that analyze a company`s data related to conducted projects and extract many data insights that can help to measure the performance of overtaken projects and help in idenifying the delayed projects and increase the rate of porject success.
